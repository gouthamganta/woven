# QA memory

## Current coordination

QA paused at the founder's request until Claude updates the repository and
documentation. Founder subsequently authorized an introduction to Claude;
`qa/CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md` contains it. No Claude acknowledgment received yet.

## Agreement — 2026-10-07

- Goal: investor-demo readiness followed by funded real-user beta; launch market
  and audience are not confirmed.
- Budget: zero paid services by default; tests run locally.
- Codex handles QA and evidence; Claude handles product implementation and is
  actively documenting the application. Avoid changing Claude's documentation.
- Founder permits clearing the local database and requests a local test account.
  No database has been cleared. Verify the target before any destructive action.
- Weekend sandbox missions may be useful, but no cloud deployment or recurring
  automation has been scheduled. Cost and exposure must be reviewed first.

## Observed environment

- Windows / PowerShell, repo `C:/Users/gauta/Desktop/Woven`.
- About 8 GB installed RAM, Intel Iris Xe graphics.
- dotnet, Node, npm, Docker, and Claude CLI are installed.
- Docker engine initially unreachable; recovered by launching Docker Desktop.
- Isolated woven-qa infrastructure is running on an internal container network;
  PostgreSQL woven_qa is healthy with 0 public tables, Redis responds PONG.
- Backend baseline failed compilation (CL-003). Frontend baseline: 3/3 unit tests
  passed. Persona fixture integrity passed; personas not yet imported.
- Baseline commit: `9b7a54e81acef1b94b44667d0eca6fb1fd0425ed`.
- Existing uncommitted implementation log and feature documentation belong to
  the active contributor. Preserve them.
- Backend .NET 10, frontend Angular 21, PostgreSQL 16/pgvector, Redis, Azurite.
- Compose publishes API 5135, frontend 80, database 5433, Redis 6379,
  blob emulator 10000. Older context describes frontend 4202.

## Resume sequence

1. Read board and findings; check git status for concurrent changes.
2. Audit effective sandbox configuration without printing secrets. Isolate
   storage and outbound traffic before starting backend workers.
3. Start/recover Docker and create a separate local QA database/volume.
4. Run migrations; validate schema-aware persona import and local login.
5. Run lifecycle smoke tests, authorization tests, and UI accessibility checks.
6. Send reproducible defects to Claude through the board; retest fixes.
7. Record run metadata and update this file. Never label an unexecuted test passed.
