# Woven

**Energy. Intention. Chemistry.**
**Where every match has potential.**

## The Experience

Dating shouldn't feel like a job. It shouldn't exhaust you. It should feel like noticing someone across a room—brief, intentional, worth your attention.

Woven is built around a simple idea: fewer choices, made more carefully, lead to better connections. Every interaction is designed to slow things down just enough that you're actually present for it.

---

## Starting Out

When you first open Woven, the onboarding feels different. There's no rush to upload six photos and write a clever bio in five minutes. Instead, you move through a short series of thoughtful steps.

First, the basics: your name, age, who you're interested in, and how far you're willing to look. Then photos—six slots, three required. Each slot has a purpose: the clear hello shot, the full-body vibe, you in your element. Optional slots let you add depth: a candid moment, a travel memory, something that makes them stop scrolling.

Next, your intent. What are you looking for? A relationship, something casual, marriage, or still figuring it out? You pick your primary goal and what you're open to. One sentence about what you want—honest, no pressure.

Then the details: a short bio, optional fields like diet, pets, hobbies, languages. You control what's public, what's private, and what's used only for matching. A weekly vibe—a short note about your current headspace—adds a layer of presence that refreshes over time.

Finally, the foundational questions. These map to **eight pillars**: dimensions like lifestyle, mindset, energy, and emotional style. They're not quizzes with right answers. They're signals. Small ways to help the app understand how you move through life, what you value, and what kinds of people you tend to connect with.

This foundational layer stays private. It's never shown on your profile. It simply informs how Woven works for you behind the scenes.

## Your Daily Moments

Each day, you receive a small deck of five profiles. We call these your **Moments**.

Five. That's it.

Not endless scrolling. Not a game of rapid-fire judgment. Just five people, chosen carefully, presented calmly. Enough to feel meaningful. Few enough that you actually look.

Each profile in your Moments invites a choice: you can pass, save for later, or spend a **spark**—a small gesture of genuine interest. You get five sparks each day, resetting at midnight. One spark per choice.

If someone catches your attention but the timing isn't right, you can save them. Saved profiles sit in a quiet space, holding up to ten people at a time. If you save an eleventh, the oldest one gently falls away. You can revisit your saved profiles anytime, though only two sparks per day can be used on them. This keeps the focus on what's in front of you now.

## How Matches Happen

When two people both spark on each other, a match forms. But not all matches feel the same—and Woven honors that.

If both of you made the same symbolic choice during your interaction, it's called a **Pure Match**. Full visibility, immediate connection. You both felt the same pull at the same moment.

If your choices differed slightly, it becomes an **Edge Match**. Here, profiles stay partially revealed until both of you send a message. It's a gentle way of saying: you're interested, but trust builds through conversation. Once both of you speak, the full picture opens.

---

## The Balloon

Every new match begins as a **Balloon**.

When both people have sent at least one message each, a quiet **five-minute timer** begins. During those five minutes, either person can choose to "pop" the Balloon—but popping isn't the end of the story.

When you pop, a **one-minute grace window** opens. Both of you can exchange final messages—a chance to say something before the moment closes. After that minute, the person who popped makes a choice: end the chat, or request to continue.

If they choose to continue, the other person receives a quiet invitation. If both agree, the Balloon transforms into a **Find Love** chat—no timers, no pressure, just two people talking.

If only one wants to continue, or if someone chooses to end, the chat closes gracefully. Either way, both people can rate the experience afterward. This feedback—private, never shared—helps Woven learn what works for you.

But if only one person ever messages—or nobody replies at all—the Balloon expires after **36 hours**. Woven won't let dead conversations linger. It values your attention too much for that.

---

## Games That Break the Ice

Sometimes a blank chat feels heavy. Woven offers two optional games to make the first moments lighter.

**Know Me** is a simple exchange: one person answers questions about themselves, and the other guesses. Each round reveals a little more about how you both think—whether you're aligned, surprised, or curious.

**Red/Green Flag** is playful prediction: you guess how your match will respond to quirky scenarios, and they do the same for you. Points are scored, but the real reward is noticing patterns in each other.

Games happen in rounds, and both people take turns. You can play up to two games per day per match. When a game ends, Woven surfaces a small insight—not a judgment, just a reflection of what the game revealed.

---

## Unlocking Something More

When you stay in a Find Love chat for **ten minutes** of genuine conversation, something small unlocks: a unique date idea, surfaced inside the chat.

It's not intrusive. It's a suggestion—something tailored, something to spark a next step if you want one. Maybe it's a quiet coffee spot, a walk through a particular neighborhood, or an unconventional activity neither of you would've thought of alone.

This is one of the few places Woven uses intelligence visibly. A small assist. Never a judgment.

---

## Rating and Reflection

After any significant interaction—whether a chat ends naturally, a balloon pops, or a match runs its course—Woven invites a quiet moment of reflection.

You can rate the experience on a simple scale, from negative to positive. This isn't about judging the other person. It's about giving Woven feedback: what kinds of connections felt right, and which ones didn't land. The rating is private, always.

If you were the one who initiated the pop, you make the final call: continue or end. If both people want to continue after the grace window, the connection lives on. If not, it closes with dignity.

---

## Pulse: Staying Present

People change. Moods shift. Energy rises and falls.

Every 24 hours, Woven offers three small **Pulse** questions—quick check-ins about your current state. How's your energy today? What tone of conversation sounds good? Are you feeling like a driver, a passenger, or somewhere between?

These aren't tests. They're signals that keep your profile alive, helping Woven adjust who you see and who sees you. Answer once, and your pulse stays fresh until the next cycle. You can always edit after the cycle ends.

---

## How the Deck Is Built

Behind your daily Moments, there's a system working quietly.

Your eight pillars feed into **soft compatibility buckets**—broader groupings like lifestyle alignment, exploration style, relationship mindset, growth orientation, and emotional rhythm. Each day, your deck is balanced across these buckets. You won't see five people who all feel the same. Variety is intentional.

If you've already seen someone, Woven waits at least **a week** before showing them again—unless there's a strong signal suggesting a second look.

And there's something else. If person A sees person B and interacts positively, Woven gently raises the chance that B will see A in their own Moments within the week. It's called **quiet intelligent boosting**. No manipulation. Just a slight nudge toward reciprocity.

Negative signals work the opposite way. If you pass on someone, or if a conversation goes nowhere, that profile's priority lowers gently. Woven learns without being obvious about it.

Over time, light **dynamic questions** appear—small prompts that keep your signals fresh without asking you to rebuild your profile. People change. The app should notice.

---

## What the Intelligence Does (And Doesn't Do)

Woven uses AI sparingly and transparently.

It helps surface **simple match explanations**—a short note about what you might have in common, grounded in what you've shared. It helps generate **thoughtful date ideas** after conversation has taken root. It writes **game insights** that reflect patterns, not judgments.

It never evaluates your worth. It never ranks your attractiveness. It never decides who "deserves" matches.

The intelligence is in service of connection, not control.

---

## The Feeling

Woven is designed around a few quiet principles:

**Limited choices** mean each one matters.
**Emotional safety** means you can exit gracefully, anytime.
**Calm pacing** means the app respects your attention.
**Quiet intelligence** means the system helps without performing.

It's not about swiping faster or matching more. It's about noticing better.

---

## Why It Exists

Most dating experiences optimize for engagement. Woven optimizes for something else: the possibility that today's small moment of attention could become something real.

Not every match will. That's fine. But every match *could*.

That's the point.

*Woven. Where every match has potential.*
